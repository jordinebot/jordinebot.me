I am Jordi Nebot, a Web Developer from [Manresa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manresa), (Barcelona). This is my blog about coding, tech, and other geeky stuff. It will probably contains come notes about my life and life hacks. I mainly write this diary for myself, to keep track of my
journey to become a better person and a better developer. But, of course, I'd like it if it could be useful to others as well.

A secondary goal for this blog is to practice and improve my written English. I am not a native English speaker, so if
you see some horrible mistake here I'll be very grateful if you [let me know](https://github.com/jordinebot/jordinebot.me/labels/spelling%20mistake).

Thank you and welcome!
