I'm a developer who loves the Web. I've been coding websites for two decades and I am making a living out of it since 2012.

I studied Computer Engineering and I'm glad to know the web tech stack from TCP/IP up to CSS all the way through server configuration, networking, protocols, requests, headers, cookies, caching, optimization opportunities, the DOM, scripting...

I've always enjoyed markup and styling layouts and since the appearance of Flexbox, CSS Grid, post-jQuery Javascript frameworks, and more and more Web APIs, Frontend Development has become exciting (and challenging!) enough for me to focus almost exclusively on this.
