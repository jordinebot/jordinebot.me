Hi, my name is Jordi, I like to think of myself as a web developer, or a
[webmaster](https://justinjackson.ca/webmaster/) if you want. But in today's industry jargon I work as a Frontend Engineer at King, in Barcelona.

I really enjoy coding but nowadays I stay away from the computer as much as I can when I finish my daily work. I try to stay active, mostly by running or hiking as well as some eventual workout at home (never been a gym guy). During 2023 I started swimming which is something I always wanted to try but never dared to. I love [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/32679880-jordi?shelf=currently-reading) and taking care of home's plants.

A while ago I left some of the main social media platforms (will probably write about that at some point) so the best way to contact me is through e-mail (`hola at jordinebot dot cat`). I'm still active in many places, though.
