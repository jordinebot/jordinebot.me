I haven't had a decent home setup for many years, but having to work from home (which I'm kinda loving, tbh) required an
update.

## Laptop

The computer is a [MacBook Pro](https://support.apple.com/kb/SP776?locale=en_US) (15-inch, 2018) with a 2,6 GHz 6-Core
Intel Core i7; 16 GB 2400 MHz DDR4, and a 1TB Flash Drive.

I use it as a secondary monitor, but it works wonders as a heater as well. This thing burns.

## Monitor

My main monitor is an [LG 24" UltraFine 4K](https://www.lg.com/us/monitors/lg-24MD4KL-B-4k-uhd-led-monitor). What can I
say? I love it! I love how the code (and everything) looks in this resolution and brightness. It's a pleasure to
look at. I also like having all my peripherals (that's mainly the keyboard and webcam) connected to it via USB-C and a
single cable to my computer (that works as a charger as well). Totally recommended.

## Keyboard

The keyboard has been my most recent acquisition. I wanted a keeb for a while, and not having anyone around while I work
allowed me to get some loud clicky switches. After some [research](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/) I fell
in love with this [Varmilo VA87M Vintage
days](https://en.varmilo.com/keyboardproscenium/subject_product_detailed?subjectid=45) with Cherry MX blues.

## Mouse

Standard Apple's [Magic Mouse 2](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MRME2LL/A/magic-mouse-2-space-gray) in silver.
Genius charging interface.

## Webcam

I use a [Logitech StreamCam](https://www.logitech.com/en-au/product/streamcam) that gets the job done. Enough video
quality (FullHD) for Zoom, not the best sound. I chose it mostly because it's USB-C.

## Headphones

I've been using these [Sennheiser HD 4.40 BT](https://en-us.sennheiser.com/wireless-headphones-bluetooth-hd-4-40-bt)
headphones for more than 2 years now and I'm really satisfied with them. More than decent sound quality, great battery
life and so confortable I can wear them for hours without annoyance. They're really good value for money.

## Octocat Figurine

A 3 inches GitHub's [Octocat Figurine](https://github.myshopify.com/products/octocat-figurine?variant=8274691333) that
lost its whiskers a while ago... It's been my coding companion for a while, and eventually plays the rubber duck role
while debbuging. I used to have a small plush caribou as well, but he's waiting in the office...

## Thermometer

To complete the picture, I also have this basic [Digoo
DG-TH1130](https://www.mydigoo.com/Digoo-DG-TH1130-Home-Comfort-Digital-Indoor-Thermometer-Hygrometer-Temperature-Humidity-Monitor-p-30.html)
thermometer/hygrometer.
