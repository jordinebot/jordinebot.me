The start of this [COVID-19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019) crisis caught me in New York City,
where apparently the virus was coming at a lower pace than in my home town. Measures weren't applied in the City yet.
Kids still were going to school, people gathered in pubs, and restaurants were crowded. And I wondered whether I would
have any issues to fly back home or not. Besides an almost four hour delay, carried from the previous flight, as far as
I know, everything was fine.

When I landed in Barcelona and left the airport I remember myself thinking that everything seemed pretty _normal_. I'd
say the highway had the traffic you'd expect by the hour. Not packed, definitely not apocalypse-empty. As I drove closer
to my hometown things started to change. Once there, the atmosphere was completely different. Shops were closed, except
for a couple of small grocery stores. Very few people on the streets, everyone was on their own, most of them wearing
N95's. Apparently, my fellow citizens were strictly following the lockdown, and so did I once I got home.

In the last two weeks I've only went out to buy groceries and essential house supplies, that is one of the grounds in
which people are allowed to leave their houses.

-   Get food and prescribed drugs.
-   Get medical assistance.
-   Go to work (if you have a job qualified as essential).
-   Go to the bank or insurance company.
-   Provide assistance to elders, children, or dependents.
-   Go back home.
-   _Force majeure_ causes.

These sixteen days I've been working from home, and even though I'd say my productivity has been affected, I must
confess I'm kind of enjoying it. Of course, I'd love to go for a run, and I'm really fortunate cause my house has pretty
big backyard, which is not common at all around here. I'll tell you more about my home office setup and morning routine
in my next posts.
