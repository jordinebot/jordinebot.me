Hi, my name is Jordi, I like to think of myself as a web developer, or a
[webmaster](https://justinjackson.ca/webmaster/) if you want. But in today's industry jargon I work as a Frontend Engineer at King, in Barcelona (well, at home because of the [pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019), you know).

I really enjoy coding but nowadays I stay away from the computer as much as I can when I finish my daily work. I try to stay active, mostly by running or hiking as well as some eventual workout at home (never been a gym guy). I love [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/32679880-jordi?shelf=currently-reading) and taking care of home's plants.

A while ago I left some of the main social media platforms (will probably write about that at some point) so the best way to contact me is through e-mail in `hola at jordinebot dot cat`. I'm still active in many places, though.
