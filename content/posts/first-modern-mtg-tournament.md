I started playing [Magic: The Gathering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic%3A_The_Gathering) around 1994, when Revised was highly popular and Fallen Empires had been recently released. My first deck, that I bought to a guy at the venue, close to the LGS, we used to go every Friday and Saturday afternoon to play and change cards; was monoblack. I remember it had [Erg Raiders](https://scryfall.com/card/3ed/109/erg-raiders), [Drudge Skeletons](https://scryfall.com/card/3ed/107/drudge-skeletons) and [Howl from Beyond](https://scryfall.com/card/3ed/114/howl-from-beyond). The best cards were a [Demonic Tutor](https://scryfall.com/card/3ed/105/demonic-tutor) and [Demonic hordes](https://scryfall.com/card/3ed/104/demonic-hordes), that I still keep.

I'd say I played regularly up until 1996, somewhere between [Homelands](https://scryfall.com/sets/hml) and [Alliances](https://scryfall.com/sets/all).
