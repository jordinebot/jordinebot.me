I’m 44 years old, and in one way or another, I’ve been creating websites for almost 30 years! From the early days of the web—when GeoCities was thriving and colorful, blinking titles were cutting-edge design—to today’s dynamic, interactive applications, my journey as a web developer has been one of constant evolution and discovery. What began as a hobby has grown into both a lifelong passion and a profession, shaped by the ever-changing landscape of technology and creativity.
