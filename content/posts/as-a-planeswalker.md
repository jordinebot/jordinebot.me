I started playing [Magic: The Gathering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic%3A_The_Gathering) around 1994, when Revised was highly popular and Fallen Empires had been recently released. My first deck, that I bought to a guy at the venue, close to the LGS we used to go every Friday and Saturday afternoon to play and change cards; was monoblack. I remember it had [Erg Raiders](https://scryfall.com/card/3ed/109/erg-raiders), [Drudge Skeletons](https://scryfall.com/card/3ed/107/drudge-skeletons) and [Howl from Beyond](https://scryfall.com/card/3ed/114/howl-from-beyond). The best cards were a [Demonic Tutor](https://scryfall.com/card/3ed/105/demonic-tutor) and [Demonic hordes](https://scryfall.com/card/3ed/104/demonic-hordes), that I still keep. I'd say I played regularly up until 1996, somewhere between [Homelands](https://scryfall.com/sets/hml) and [Alliances](https://scryfall.com/sets/all).

Years later (I guess around 2010), there was a tournament in my area and (I don't know why) I decided to go. From what I can recall, my guess is it was a Legacy tournament. I didn't know most of the cards people were playing and I lost every single game miserably... I was very impressed by a match I played against a [MUD](https://mtgdecks.net/Legacy/mud) deck with [Metalworker](https://scryfall.com/card/uds/135/metalworker), [Tangle Wire](https://scryfall.com/card/nem/139/tangle-wire), [Lodestone Golem](https://scryfall.com/card/mm2/219/lodestone-golem)... I wasn't able to play anything! I've been trying to scratch the Internet for some information on that tournament without much success so far, even though I found a player from the area that I'm almost certain had to be there...

Then, in 2021, my nephews appeared into a family lunch with some Magic cards, one thing lead to the other, and I've been playing almost weekly with some friends since then. We run yearly Pauper and Kitchen-table (aka Budget Vintage) leagues, we are getting into [Australian Highlander](https://7ph.com.au/) and, all in all, we have a lot of fun. We even have a web app that I developed to keep track of the leaderboards, deck and player stats, and whatnot.

Recently, I got into Modern and I even played my first tournament in many years!
