I am Jordi Nebot, a Web Developer from [Manresa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manresa) (Barcelona). Check my
[About](/about) page if you want to know me a little better. This is my blog about coding, tech, and other geeky stuff.
It will probably contain some notes about my life too, things I read, things I enjoy... 

I mainly write this diary for myself, to keep track of my journey to become a better person and developer.  But, of
course, I'd love it if it could be useful to others as well.

A secondary goal for this blog is to practice and improve my written English. I am not a native English speaker, so if
you see some horrible mistake I'll be very grateful if you [let me
know.](https://github.com/jordinebot/jordinebot.me/issues/new?assignees=&labels=spelling-grammar&template=spelling-or-grammar.md&title=)

Thank you and welcome!
